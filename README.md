# Player Score Management System

Welcome to the Player Score Management System! This project provides a powerful API to manage player data efficiently. With this system, you can enjoy the following facilities:

1. **Create**: Add a new player entry to the database.
2. **Update**: Modify player attributes, such as name and score.
3. **Delete**: Remove player entries from the database.
4. **Retrieve**: Get a list of all players in descending order.
5. **Rank**: Fetch players based on their rank.
6. **Random**: Get a random player from the database.

With these features, you can easily manage and organize player data for your application. Get started with the Player Score Management System now!

## Setup

## Usage

1. Build and Run the Application:

   To run the Player Score Management System, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image (if needed)
   docker build -t my-go-app .

   # Run the Docker container with the application
   docker run -p 9000:9000 --network="host" my-go-app
   ```

2. Access the API Endpoints:

   The application exposes the following API endpoints:

   - **GET /players**: Get a list of all players.
     ```bash
     curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9000/players'
     ```

   - **GET /players/rank/:val**: Get players with a specific rank.
     ```bash
     curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9000/players/rank/1'
     ```

   - **GET /players/random**: Get a random player from the database.
     ```bash
     curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9000/players/random'
     ```

   - **DELETE /players/:id**: Delete a player entry by ID.
     ```bash

     ```

Feel free to explore and use the API endpoints to manage player data efficiently!

## Improvements

- You may add information about error handling and response formats for each API endpoint in the README.
- You can provide a brief description of the application architecture and any external libraries or packages used.
- Consider including a section on how to contribute to the project or provide a link to the GitHub repository if it's open-source.
- If there are any additional setup steps required (such as environment variables or configuration files), include them in the Setup section.
- Add information on how to stop the Docker container (if desired) using the `docker stop` command.
